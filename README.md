Number Guessing Game

This Python program implements a classic number guessing game where you try to guess a randomly chosen number within a limited number of attempts.
**********************************************************
How to Play:

1. Start the game: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

2. Choose difficulty: Select "easy" for 10 attempts or "hard" for 5 attempts.

3. Make guesses: Enter your guesses one by one.

4. Receive feedback:
   
      "Too low" if your guess is lower than the target number.
   
      "Too high" if your guess is higher than the target number.

6. Win or lose:
   
      If you guess the correct number within the allotted attempts, you win!
   
      If you exhaust all your attempts without guessing correctly, you lose.
